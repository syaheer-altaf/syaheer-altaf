# Hello, I'm Mohamed Syaheer Altaf! 👋

I am a graduate student with a specialization in computer engineering. 
My passion lies at the intersection of computer science and applied mathematics. 
Though, lately I have been dabbling with cybersecurity, let's see where that takes me.
This GitHub account serves as a hub for my personal projects and small ideas.

## About Me

- 🎓 Graduate student, Computer Engineering
- 💻 Enthusiast in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics
- 🕹️ Retrocomputing Hobbyist

## My Projects

Feel free to explore the repositories I've worked on. They showcase my journey into the world of coding and problem-solving.

I am looking to collaborate on the following:

### rag_4_cpr

RAG for Competitive Programming [(rag_4_cpr)](https://github.com/syaheer-altaf/rag_4_cpr.git) is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to assist with solving competitive programming problems efficiently. 
The project aims to combine retrieval-based techniques with advanced LLM reasoning to deliver optimal solutions.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of retrocomputing, relishing the timeless charm of vintage computing systems. 
I particularly enjoy coding in BASIC despite its limitations.
